        1.  Character Format Specifier ==> %c in C
                The %c is the format specifier for the char
                data type in C language. 



        2.  Integer Format Specifier (signed) â€“ %d in C
                The %d is the format specifier for the signed 
                integer data type in c language.

                The int type in C is a signed integer, 
                which means it can represent both negative and positive numbers. 

                A signed integer is a 32-bit data that encodes an integer in the
                range [-2147483648 to 2147483647]. 



        3.  unsigned Interger Format Specifier -%u in c
                The %u is the format specifier for the unsigned
                integer data type in c language.

                This is in contrast to an unsigned integer 
                (which can be used by declaring a variable unsigned int),
                which can only represent positive numbers.
    
                An unsigned integer is a 32-bit datum that encodes a 
                nonnegative integer in the range [0 to 4294967295]. 



        4.  floating-point Format Specifier ==> %f in C
                The %f is the format specifier for the float
                data type in C language.
