
/* C is a general-purpose, procedural, high-level programming language.

    C language was developed by Dennis M. Ritchie (डेनिस एम. रिची ) at 
    the Bell Telephone Laboratories( U.S.A.) in 1972.

    It is a powerful and flexible language which was first developed 
    for the programming of the UNIX operating System. 

    A procedure is known as a function, method, routine, subroutine, etc.

    A procedural language specifies a series of steps for the program to
    solve the problem.

    It used in development of computer software and application,system 
    - programming , games and web development.

    C is one of the most widely used programming language.

    It is the best choice to start with programming as 
    it gives you a foundational understanding of programming.

    C is very fast, compared to other programming languages, like Java and Python.

    The main difference between C and C++ is that C++ support classes and objects,
    while C does not.

    C language is considered as the mother language of all the modern 
    programming languages because most of the compilers, JVMs, Kernels, etc.
    are written in C language, and most of the programming languages 
    follow C syntax, for example, C++, Java, C#, etc.

    A structured programming language is a subset of the procedural language.
    Structure means to break a program into parts or blocks so that it may be easy to understand.
